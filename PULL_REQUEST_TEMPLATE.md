- Create a new file with your concept.md inside the propositions folder.
- Edit README.md and add the direct link to your concept file
```Example :
Different propositions :
- [I'm a better concept](/concepts/betterconcept.md)
```
- If your file is then voted to be a better solution, it will then replace the current concept.
